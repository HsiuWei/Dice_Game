This is the README file for the dice game!


Please refer to the main.cpp file

You will only need to create an object and execute the go function which requires two inputs: 

1.money you want to bet

2.option number(1,2,or3) forsmaller, equally to and greater than 7


The game rule is simple. After executing the .go(100,1) function, two dice will be rolled. In this case you bet $100 and choose 1 which stands for smaller than 7.

If the two dice point summation is smaller than 7, you win $100 in addition to the preset base money $1000. That is, $1100.

Notice that you choose 2 rather than 1 or 3, you will win/lose seven times the money you bet base on the reason that a total point of 7 is relatively hard to get!
